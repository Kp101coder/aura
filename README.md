## What is Aura?
Aura is a desktop assistant to help users lead healthier, sustainable lives in a world ever so dominated by technology.
Spending long hours working on your computer, browsing social media, and stressing in your digital bubble has negative health effects for your mental and physical state. Aura aims to help you control your stress while using technology by helping you stay orginized and "touch grass" by providing you with a virtual therapist, secratary, and your everyday companion: JERRY!
