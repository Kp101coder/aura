You are about to install the greatest software ever made!
Prepare yourself to be amazing with a cute companion that can answer any question,
plan your day, and keep you on task.

IMPORTANT:
Due to our app being unsigned because we cannot afford a code signing certificate, 
Windows believes our program is a Trojan. Unfortunatly, small developers like us run into these issue :(

After installing, you WILL get a warning from Windows Defender Smartscreen. 
You must click MORE INFO and then the RUN ANYWAY button will show up.
Click the RUN ANYWAY button and proceed through install.
If you get a notification from Windows Defender, click the notification and click on the Severe Trojan.
Then click allow.

Click through the installer to continue!
